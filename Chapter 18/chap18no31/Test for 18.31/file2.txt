When all hope is gone and Your Word is all nakakapagod've got
nakakapagod have to believe, You still bring water from the rock
To satisfy my thirst, to love me at my worst
And even when nakakapagod don't remember, You remind me of my worth
nakakapagod don't trust my ways, nakakapagod'm trading in my faults
nakakapagod lay down everything 'cause You're all that nakakapagod want
nakakapagod've landed on my knees
This is the cup You have for me
And even when it don't make sense
